# NES Emulator
A Nintendo ES emulator, in the end it's slop code, but I just had to do it for the culture.


# Requirements
- C compiler (Clang or GCC)
- For now I can only guarantee UNIX-like OS (macOS ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ)

# To build
- Run this on the terminal
```sh
sh build.sh
```
*For release*
```sh
sh build-release.sh
```


# To run
- Run the build (not doing anything yet ðŸ˜”)
```sh
sh build/nes_emu <game_file_path>
```
*For release*
```sh
sh build/nes_emu_release <game_file_path>
```
